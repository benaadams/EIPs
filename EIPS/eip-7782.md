## Abstract

Reduce Ethereum's slot time from 12 s to 6 s, halving on‑chain latency and epoch duration. This doubles slot throughput while keeping block and blob sizes unchanged, smoothing bandwidth usage. The change delivers better user experience, faster Layer 2 interaction, tighter DEX pricing, reduced MEV, and quicker finality.

## Motivation

- **Enhanced UX**: Confirmations now arrive in ~6 s instead of 12 s.
- **Faster Finality**: Epochs shrink from 384 s (32 × 12 s) to 192 s (32 × 6 s), accelerating Casper‑FFG finality.
- **L2 Interoperability**: Layer 2 rollups see half the settlement delay on L1, improving throughput and reducing reorg risk period.
- **Based rollups**: Based rollup sequencing is tied to L1 block time so faster blocks directly improves based rollups.
- **DEX Economics**: More frequent blocks narrow price spreads, reduce slippage, and lower arbitrage friction.
- **Bandwidth Smoothing**: Doubling slot rate distributes bandwidth evenly without increasing peak block size; nodes with modest capacity remain supported.

## Specification

On the consensus layer, a new parameter is added to the configuration:

```
BLOB_SCHEDULE:
  - EPOCH: 348618
    SECONDS_PER_SLOT: 12
  - EPOCH: 355368
    SECONDS_PER_SLOT: 6
```

The parameters and schedules above are purely illustrative. Actual values and schedules are beyond the scope of this specification.

## Rationale

This proposal balances user experience, economic efficiency, and network stability:

- UX & Finality: Halving slot time directly reduces confirmation latency and halves epoch duration, delivering faster feedback to users and speeding up Casper-FFG finality.

- Economic Efficiency: Increased block frequency tightens DEX price spreads, lowers slippage, and diminishes arbitrage and MEV opportunities, improving on-chain trading conditions.

- L2 & Based Rollups Synergy: Layer 2 rollups, especially based rollups, benefit from reduced L1 settlement delays, enhancing throughput and user-perceived performance in rollup ecosystems.

- Network Stability: Maintaining existing block and blob limits smooths bandwidth usage over time, avoiding peak-load spikes and preserving accessibility for nodes with diverse bandwidth capacities.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backwards compatibility concerns.

## Security Considerations

- **Network Congestion**:

  - **Increased Message Frequency**: The network must handle more frequent messages without congestion.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement network optimizations and encourage the use of efficient client software.

- **Consensus Integrity**:

  - **Fork Choice Stability**: Ensure that the fork choice rule remains robust against potential reorganization attacks.
  - **Finality Gadgets**: Confirm that finality mechanisms function correctly under new timing conditions.
